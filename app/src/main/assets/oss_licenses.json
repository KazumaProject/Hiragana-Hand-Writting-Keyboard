While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "licenseText": "Eclipse Public License - v 1.0\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC\nLICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation\n   distributed under this Agreement, and\nb) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n   i) changes to the Program, and\n   ii) additions to the Program;\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\ndistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\nContributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\nacting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\nthe Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\nconjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are\nnot derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\nreproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\ndistribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and\nsuch derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\nPatents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\nContribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\nThis patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\nProgram if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\naddition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\nLicensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\nwhich include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to\nits Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\nContributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\nproperty rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability\nto Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\nintellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\nrights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\nresponsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\nFor example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\ndistribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that\nlicense before distributing the Program.\n\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\ncopyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license\nset forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\nits own license agreement, provided that:\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\nb) its license agreement:\n   i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\n      conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of\n      title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of\n      merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n   ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n       damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n       consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n   iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\n        by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n   iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n       Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n       manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\nProgram.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\nany, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\noriginator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\na Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nContributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\nand costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\nactions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\nextent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\nconnection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\noffering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\nto qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nContributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor\nto control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and\nany related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\nCommercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\nrelated to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\nCommercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\nCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\nrequires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\nContributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\nand distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise\nof rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and\ncosts of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of\ndata, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\nSTRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY\nWAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\nlaw, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\nterms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\nprovision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\nprovision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\nSection 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\nnot cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\nsuch noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\nand any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\nand survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\norder to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\nmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\npublish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\nNo one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\nThe Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation\nmay assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable\nseparate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\ndistinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always\nbe distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\nContributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)\nunder the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)\nabove, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of\nany Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under\nthis Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\nany resulting litigation.\n"
